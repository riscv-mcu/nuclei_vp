This library provides SystemC CPUs.

It can load shared libraries developped with TLM2C.

How to include this model in a project:

* Copy the misc/FindSIMPLECPU.cmake in your project repository.
* Add the following lines into your CMakeLists.txt:
    FIND_PACKAGE(SIMPLECPU)
    if(SIMPLECPU_FOUND)
      INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${SIMPLECPU_INCLUDE_DIRS})
      LINK_DIRECTORIES(${SIMPLECPU_LIBRARY_DIRS})
    else()
      MESSAGE(FATAL_ERROR "SIMPLECPU not found.")
    endif()

You're now able to use SimpleCPU headers and link the toplevel with
SIMPLECPU_LIBRARIES.
